At the project root you have to call from terminal:

1. composer install
2. php bin/console doctrine:database:create
3. php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force

If you have downloaded an archive then you should change the params to connect DB in app/config/parameters.yml (database_name, database_password end etc) and do the step 2 and the step 3
